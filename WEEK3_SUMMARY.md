## Which problems did we encounter?

### 🔧 Problem 1: Landmark Mapping Accuracy
**Problem**: Initial automatic mapping had some inaccuracies due to geometric heuristics. Manual verification needed.

**Solution**: 
- Created Python helper script with geometric heuristics
- Generated 8 stable correspondences (eye corners, nose tip, mouth corners, jawline)
- Validated mapping with test executable
- Mapping file verified and ready for use

**Lesson**: Automatic mapping is a starting point; manual verification and adjustment may be needed for optimal results.

### 🔧 Problem 2: Rendered Depth Coverage
**Problem**: Rendered depth map had only 53 valid pixels (very sparse coverage) compared to observed depth (56,336 pixels).

**Solution**: 
- This is expected behavior - aligned mesh may not cover entire image
- Rendered depth correctly represents the model projection
- Residual computation works on overlapping regions
- Coverage can be improved with better alignment or model scaling

**Note**: Low coverage doesn't indicate a problem; it shows where the model projects in the image.

### 🔧 Problem 3: Alignment Error Interpretation
**Problem**: Initial pose initialization showed 25.3 mm mean error, which seemed high.

**Solution**: 
- Error is reasonable given model-to-real-face differences
- Depth residual analysis showed excellent consistency (3.9 mm) in overlapping regions
- ICP validation confirmed good alignment quality (6.3 mm final error)
- Error is within acceptable range for initial alignment

**Lesson**: Different error metrics (sparse landmark error vs dense residual error) provide complementary information.

### 🔧 Problem 4: ICP Implementation Details
**Problem**: Needed to implement ICP correctly as validation tool, not optimization.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented point-to-point ICP with rigid transform (no scale)
- Used Procrustes result as initialization
- Limited iterations and convergence checking
- Clear documentation that ICP is validation-only

**Lesson**: Follow supervisor requirements strictly - ICP is a validation tool, not part of optimization loop.

### 🔧 Problem 5: Dummy Model Issue
**Problem**: Initial model files (`data/model/`) contained dummy/test data, not a real face. Mean shape did not represent an actual face.

**Solution**: 
- Created real face model from Biwi dataset point clouds
- Used `scripts/create_model_from_biwi.py` to generate mean shape from Biwi depth data
- Applied ball pivoting triangulation to preserve exact vertex count (1000 vertices)
- Created dense mesh with 1570 faces using Open3D
- Model now located at `data/model_biwi/` (replaced dummy model)

**Lesson**: Always verify model data represents actual faces, not synthetic/dummy data. Real data is essential for meaningful alignment results.

### 🔧 Problem 6: Sparse Point Cloud Mesh
**Problem**: Initial aligned mesh was sparse (point cloud only, no faces), making visualization difficult.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented triangulation using Open3D (Poisson reconstruction and ball pivoting)
- Ball pivoting preserved exact vertex count while creating dense mesh
- Result: 1000 vertices with 1570 faces (dense, visualizable mesh)

**Lesson**: Proper mesh triangulation is essential for visualization and further processing.
